# This is a markdown file to do some of the optional next steps.

So what have I learned? Most of this has been a review. The only things I did not know about before was that profiles themselves (in addition to repos) could have their own readme file and also that GitHub Explore was a feature that GitHub had. I will definitely look forward to making a profile readme when it is time to apply for jobs.

I will now commit this to a new branch and make a pull request as a way of "formally" acknowledging this repo is complete.
